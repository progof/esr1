elspero Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
elspero Core is the original elspero client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of elspero transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download elspero Core, visit [faithco.in](http://faithco.in).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run elspero on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/elspero-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/elsperod` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run elspero-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag elspero-Core to your applications folder, and then run elspero-Core.
